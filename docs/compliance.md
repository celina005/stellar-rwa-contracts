# Compliance Contract

The compliance contract is the **core differentiator** of the RWA Toolkit. It
maintains the KYC allowlist and jurisdiction rules that decide who may hold or
transfer a tokenized asset. The asset-token contract calls
[`is_allowed`](#is_allowed---bool) on **both** parties of every transfer and on
the recipient of every mint.

## Types

### `ComplianceStatus`

```rust
enum ComplianceStatus { Approved, Pending, Rejected, Suspended }
```

Only `Approved` records (that are not expired and not in a blocked jurisdiction)
pass `is_allowed`.

### `KycRecord`

| Field         | Type              | Meaning                                             |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `address`     | `Address`         | The account this record applies to                  |
| `status`      | `ComplianceStatus`| Approval state                                      |
| `jurisdiction`| `String`          | ISO country code, e.g. `"US"`                       |
| `verified_at` | `u32`             | Ledger sequence at verification                     |
| `expires_at`  | `u32`             | Ledger sequence of expiry; `0` = never expires      |

> Time is measured in **ledger sequence numbers**, not calendar dates.

## Functions

### `initialize(admin: Address)`
Sets the admin. Callable once. Requires `admin` auth.
Errors: `AlreadyInitialized (#1)`.

### `add_to_allowlist(admin, address, jurisdiction, expires_at)`
Approves `address` (status → `Approved`) in `jurisdiction`, expiring at
`expires_at` (`0` = never). Admin only.
Errors: `Unauthorized (#5)`, `InvalidExpiry (#4)` if `expires_at` is already in
the past.

### `suspend(admin, address)`
Sets an existing record to `Suspended`; `is_allowed` returns `false` until
re-approved. Admin only. Errors: `RecordNotFound (#3)`, `Unauthorized (#5)`.

### `remove(admin, address)`
Deletes a record and removes the address from the allowlist. Admin only.
Errors: `RecordNotFound (#3)`, `Unauthorized (#5)`.

### `is_allowed(address) -> bool`
The gate used by the asset token. Returns `true` **iff** the address has a
record that is `Approved`, not expired, and whose jurisdiction is not blocked.
Never panics.

### `get_record(address) -> Option<KycRecord>`
Raw record, or `None`.

### `get_allowlist() -> Vec<Address>`
Every address currently on the allowlist.

### `block_jurisdiction(admin, jurisdiction)` / `unblock_jurisdiction(admin, jurisdiction)`
Block/unblock an entire country code. Approved addresses in a blocked
jurisdiction fail `is_allowed`. Admin only.

### `is_jurisdiction_blocked(jurisdiction) -> bool`
Whether a jurisdiction is currently blocked.

### `get_admin() -> Address`
The configured admin. Errors: `NotInitialized (#2)`.

### `transfer_admin(admin, new_admin)`
Hands admin control to `new_admin`. Requires the **current** admin's auth.
Errors: `Unauthorized (#5)`.

## Errors

| Code | Name                | Cause                                   |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1    | AlreadyInitialized  | `initialize` called twice               |
| 2    | NotInitialized      | Used before `initialize`                |
| 3    | RecordNotFound      | Operating on a missing record           |
| 4    | InvalidExpiry       | `expires_at` already in the past        |
| 5    | Unauthorized        | Caller is not the stored admin          |

## Storage / TTL

| Key | Payload | Storage | TTL / Notes |
|-----|---------|---------|-------------|
| `Admin` | - | instance | - |
| `Allowlist` | - | instance | - |
| `Record` | Address | persistent | per-key TTL |
| `Blocked` | String | unknown | - |

## Admin independence from the asset-token admin (issue #3)

The admin stored by this contract is entirely separate from the `admin`
stored by any asset-token contract that points at it as its
`compliance_contract`. The two are never compared, and neither contract reads
the other's admin — the asset token only ever calls the read-only
`is_allowed`.

[`scripts/deploy.sh`](../scripts/deploy.sh) initializes both contracts with
the same address (`$ADMIN_ADDR`). That is a **convenience default** for
standing up a single-operator demo/testnet deployment in one command, **not**
a requirement of the contracts. A real issuer can run compliance under a
dedicated compliance officer's address while a different address administers
the asset token, simply by calling `initialize` on each contract with a
different admin, e.g.:

```bash
invoke "$COMPLIANCE_ID" initialize --admin "$COMPLIANCE_OFFICER_ADDR"
invoke "$ASSET_ID" initialize --admin "$ISSUER_ADDR" ...
```

`contracts/asset-token/src/test.rs::test_compliance_admin_diverges_from_asset_admin`
proves this: it initializes the two contracts with distinct admins, shows the
compliance officer can independently approve/suspend addresses and the asset
admin can independently mint/pause, and confirms neither admin can act on the
other's contract.

## Security considerations

- All state-changing functions require the **stored admin** to both authorize
  (`require_auth`) and match the passed `admin` argument.
- `is_allowed` is intentionally total (never panics) so the asset token can rely
  on it inside transfers.
- Expiry is enforced against `env.ledger().sequence()` at read time, so an
  expired KYC blocks transfers without any keeper/cron.
